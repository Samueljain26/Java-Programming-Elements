# Java-Programming-Elements
1. Java Comments
Ignored by the Java compiler.
Used to improve code readability.
2. Java Data Types
int → Whole numbers (no decimals).
double → Floating-point numbers (with decimals).
char → Single character (enclosed in single quotes ‘’).
String → Text (enclosed in double quotes “”).
3. Best Programming Practices
Use variables for all values (fixed, user input, and results).
 Avoid hard coding values wherever possible.
 Follow proper naming conventions for variables.
   example:-
   {
   String name = "Eric";  
double height = input.nextDouble();  
double totalDistance = distanceFromToVia + distanceViaToFinalCity

}
Ensure a proper program and class name.
Maintain proper indentation for readability
